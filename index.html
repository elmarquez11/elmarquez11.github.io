      <h2> About Me</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Elizabeth Marquez. I am a founding 9th grader
            at Alpha Cindy Avitia High School. I love One Direction, 
            and an image of them placed under my name. Besides One Direction,
            I also like bands like Five Seconds of Summer, or Twenty
            One Pilots, and many other artists like Halsey or Ed 
            Sheeran. Besides my love of music, I also have a love of 
            reading. I love to read any type of genre of books, just
            like I like any type of genre of music. I am a very
            indecisive person, and if I had one word to describe
            myself, it would be <em> paradox.</em> A paradox is a person
            who self-contradicts themselves. I am currently on the
            founding girls soccer team at Alpha, and volunteer my 
            time at events to help out. I am also currently
            bilingual but plan on learning many more languages
            since one of my goals are to travel many places
            and expierence new cultures and places. The two languages
            I know are English and Spanish. I don't have a specific
            college in mind, but I do want to become a photographer,
            travel, and or become a lawyer. I want to do good, and
            bring justice and fairness. I want to give back to my
            community and family. I want to make a positive 
            difference in this world. I want to bring change. I want
            to change the bad and support the good. <em>But,</em> in
            order to create change, I should start with myself. I 
            plan on living on the present, and having my current
            goal be to getting good grades in high school so I can 
            graduate and get into the college of my choice.
